## ‚ö°Ô∏è Features

## üìã Installation

There are two branches to install from:

* `main` (default, **recommended**) will have latest development version of plugin. All changes since last stable release should be perceived as being in beta testing phase (meaning they already passed alpha-testing and are moderately settled).
* `stable` will be updated only upon releases with code tested during public beta-testing phase in `main` branch.

Here are code snippets for some common installation methods:

* With [folke/lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim):

| Branch | Code snippet                                         |
|--------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Main   | `{ 'jokajak/keyseer.nvim', version = false },`       |
| Stable | `{ 'jokajak/keyseer.nvim', version = '*' },`         |

* With [wbthomason/packer.nvim](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim):

| Branch | Code snippet                                         |
|--------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Main   | `use 'jokajak/keyseer.nvim'`                         |
| Stable | `use { 'jokajak/keyseer.nvim', branch = 'stable' }`  |

<summary>Click to unfold the full list of options with their default values</summary>

> **Note**: The options are also available in Neovim by calling `:h keyseer.options`

```lua
KeySeer.config = {
  -- Prints useful logs about what event are triggered, and reasons actions are executed.
  debug = false,
  -- Initial neovim mode to display keybindings
  initial_mode = "n",

  -- Boolean to include built in keymaps in display
  include_builtin_keymaps = false,
  -- Boolean to include global keymaps in display
  include_global_keymaps = true,
  -- Boolean to include buffer keymaps in display
  include_buffer_keymaps = true,
  -- TODO: Represent modifier toggling in highlights
  -- Boolean to include modified keys (e.g. <C-x> or <A-y> or C) in display
  include_modified_keypresses = false,
  -- TODO: Support ignoring whichkey conflicts when showing builtin keymaps
  -- Boolean to ignore whichkey keymaps
  ignore_whichkey_conflicts = true,

  -- Configuration for ui:
  -- - `border` defines border (as in `nvim_open_win()`).
  ui = {
    border = "double", -- none, single, double, shadow
    margin = { 1, 0, 1, 0 }, -- extra window margin [top, right, bottom, left]
    winblend = 0, -- value between 0-100 0 for fully opaque and 100 for fully transparent
    size = {
      width = 65,
      height = 10,
    },
    icons = {
      keyseer = "ÔÑú",
    },
    show_header = true, -- boolean if the header should be shown
  },

  -- Keyboard options
  keyboard = {
    -- Layout of the keycaps
    ---@type string|Keyboard
    layout = "qwerty",
    keycap_padding = { 0, 1, 0, 1 }, -- padding around keycap labels [top, right, bottom, left]
    -- How much padding to highlight around each keycap
    highlight_padding = { 0, 0, 0, 0 },
    -- override the label used to display some keys.
    key_labels = {
      ["Up"] = "‚Üë",
      ["Down"] = "‚Üì",
      ["Left"] = "‚Üê",
      ["Right"] = "‚Üí",

      ["<F8>"] = "F8",
      ["<F9>"] = "F9",
      ["<F10>"] = "F10",

      -- For example:
      -- ["<space>"] = "SPC",
      -- ["<cr>"] = "RET",
      -- ["<tab>"] = "TAB",
    },
  },
}
